# AMR-Project-Anti-Ackerman-
Aidan Fitzpatrick AMR Final Project

Why? 
Anti-Ackerman steering, is the drive platform used in Formula 1 cars, a high-performance speed and efficiency vehicle, in which the outermost (front) wheel is steered slightly more than the innermost (front) wheel on turns. This is employed to allow for the most amount of grip and thus speed performance. Formula 1 is a field I find very interesting and relevant to this course, as it can be considered the pinnacle of engineering and performance under strict guidelines and restrictions, much like autonomous driving and robots.

Traditional Ackerman steering is used in regular commercial cars and minimizes tire slip, thus limiting wear on the tires and increasing longevity. However, this limits performance, as a tire has to have a lateral slippage in order to create a cornering force. If there is more slippage (slip angle) on the outermost tire, than the innermost, there will be more grip on the car and the vehicle will turn faster and more efficiently (at the cost of tire wear). This is achieved by having the outer tire turn more than the inner.

Pros of Anti-Ackerman:
Optimization of Slip-Angles at High-Speed
Better Cornering Force

Pros of 4 Wheel:
Easier modelling and more practical
Sufficient stability
Option to introduce suspension variable 

4-Wheel Anti-Ackerman: Operational Design Domain:
Roadway Type: Flat, hard, smooth, dry surface with no elevation changes (2-dimensional plane/planar motion)
Vehicle Configuration: 4-wheels, outer (front) wheel turn angle is larger than inner (front) wheel turn angle
Wheel Dynamics: No-slip condition (rolling without slip)
Chassis Dimensions: Known track widths and wheel bases
